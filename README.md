# CompassHead

# This is a demonstration app for displaying the bearing/azimuth of a compass using React Native and device sensors.

# Introduction

CompassHead is a React Native application that shows the device’s current heading in degrees and cardinal directions (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW). It uses the device’s magnetometer sensor to provide real-time compass functionality with smoothly transitioning text colors corresponding to direction changes. It also includes a recalibration feature.
